                <h2> The Dat Dog Story</h2>
                <p id="main Content">
                    Does the idea of a hot dog put a smile on your face? Does it remind you of happy times at a picnic,
                    a
                    ballpark, or on vacation? could an Irish Guinness sausage with andouille sauce, onions, shredded
                    cheddar
                    cheese, bacon and yellow mustard resurrect those positive vibes? Then you understand the reason Dat
                    Dog
                    was opened in a 475 sq. ft. shack in a post Katrina New Orleans neighborhood on February 14, 2011.
